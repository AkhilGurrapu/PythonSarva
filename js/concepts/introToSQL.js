            <h2 class="topic-title">Welcome to SQL Learner</h2>

            <h3 class="topic-subtitle">What is SQL?</h3>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows you to:</p>
            <ul class="topic-list">
                <li>Retrieve data from databases</li>
                <li>Insert new records</li>
                <li>Update existing records</li>
                <li>Delete records</li>
                <li>Create new databases and tables</li>
                <li>Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="topic-subtitle">Why Learn SQL?</h3>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">SQL is essential for:</p>
            <ul class="topic-list">
                <li>Data analysts and scientists for data manipulation and analysis</li>
                <li>Backend developers for managing application data</li>
                <li>Database administrators for maintaining and optimizing databases</li>
                <li>Business intelligence professionals for creating reports and dashboards</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="topic-subtitle">Database Schema and Data Model</h3>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">In this app, you'll be working with a sample database that includes the following tables:</p>
            <ul class="topic-list">
                <li>Customers: Information about individual customers</li>
                <li>Products: Details of products available for sale</li>
                <li>Stores: Information about different store locations</li>
                <li>Dates: A date dimension table for time-based analysis</li>
                <li>Sales: Transaction data linking customers, products, stores, and dates</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">You can view the complete schema by clicking on the "Database Schema" button within "Schema", which shows detailed information about each table and its columns.</p>

            <h3 class="topic-subtitle">Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)</h3>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">The ERD provides a visual representation of the database structure, showing how different tables are related. Key features of our ERD include:</p>
            <ul class="topic-list">
                <li>Tables represented as rectangles with column details</li>
                <li>Primary keys (PK) indicated with a ðŸ”‘ symbol</li>
                <li>Foreign keys (FK) indicated with a ðŸ”— symbol</li>
                <li>Relationships between tables shown as dotted lines</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">You can view the ERD by clicking on the "Model View" button. This diagram helps in understanding table relationships and designing complex queries.</p>

            <h3 class="topic-subtitle">How to Use This App</h3>
            <p class="topic-paragraph">This SQL Learner app is designed to help you learn SQL interactively:</p>
            <ol class="topic-list">
